The Contract</p></div> <br><p>These conditions and other information in all Etihad Holidays\' brochures, price booklets, separate publicity material and our web site form the contract between you and us. All Holidays are subject to availability and these booking conditions. In the event of any conflict between these booking conditions and any of the brochures, price booklets, separate publicity material or our web site, these booking conditions will prevail. </p><br><p>You are recommended to read these booking conditions carefully and in the event that there is anything, which you do not understand, contact Etihad Holidays (or your Travel Agent if you have booked via an agent) for clarification. </p><br><p>You need to be aware that these conditions contain a limitation of our liability to you and of our obligations in relation to any Holiday, which you book. </p><br><p>These conditions do not govern your contract or affect your rights relating to any third party whose services you may separately purchased and use on your Holiday. </p><br><p>When you have booked your Holiday, paid a deposit and we have issued a confirmation or receipt to you or to your Travel Agent and you have signed our booking form, a contract exists between you and us. The Lead Name guarantees that he or she has full authority to make the Holiday booking on behalf of all customers named on the Holiday booking and guarantees to pay all sums which are or may become due in relation to such Holiday. </p><br><p>The purchase and sale of the Holiday shall take place (or shall be deemed to take place) and come into effect in the UAE, whatever the circumstances of your booking. Notwithstanding any conflict of laws principles, these booking conditions and any contract between you and us shall be governed exclusively by the laws of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and the federal laws of the UAE, and the Civil Courts of the UAE in Abu Dhabi shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine any dispute or claim that arises out of or in connection with the contract with you or its subject matter or formation (including non- contractual disputes or claims). </p><div class="header"><br><p>2. How to Book</p></div><br><p> A Holiday booking can be made through Etihad Holidays Retail Shops, Sales Offices or directly with the Etihad Holidays Call Centre +9712 5990700 in the UAE or through a Travel Agent. </p><br><p>When a booking is made via a Travel Agent, all communication with Etihad Holidays must be made via the Travel Agent. In that case, all monies paid by you to the Travel Agent are held by the Travel Agent as your agent until the booking is accepted and confirmed by Etihad Holidays. </p><div class="header"><br><p>3. Payment</p></div><br><p> A booking form must be completed and signed by the Lead Name being a person aged 18 years or over and a non-refundable deposit paid to Etihad Holidays of 10% of the total package cost. Should your Holiday incorporate a specialist holiday component such as Cruise Companies, ("Specialist Holiday") and some hotels a full payment will be required and will be advised at the time of booking. If the booking is made 16 days or less prior to departure full payment will also be required for your Holiday booking. </p><br><p>If a deposit has been paid the full balance must be settled no later than 16 days before your departure date. If we do not receive the balance by the due date we will treat the booking as cancelled by you and you agree to pay the cancellation charges as described in section 5.2 of these booking conditions. We accept cash, cheques, credit and debit cards. </p><br><p>Once full payment has been received for a confirmed booking, Etihad Holidays will issue air E-tickets plus vouchers for other services booked.

The Contract</p></div> <br><p>These conditions and other information in all Etihad Holidays\' brochures, price booklets, separate publicity material and our web site form the contract between you and us. All Holidays are subject to availability and these booking conditions. In the event of any conflict between these booking conditions and any of the brochures, price booklets, separate publicity material or our web site, these booking conditions will prevail. </p><br><p>You are recommended to read these booking conditions carefully and in the event that there is anything, which you do not understand, contact Etihad Holidays (or your Travel Agent if you have booked via an agent) for clarification. </p><br><p>You need to be aware that these conditions contain a limitation of our liability to you and of our obligations in relation to any Holiday, which you book. </p><br><p>These conditions do not govern your contract or affect your rights relating to any third party whose services you may separately purchased and use on your Holiday. </p><br><p>When you have booked your Holiday, paid a deposit and we have issued a confirmation or receipt to you or to your Travel Agent and you have signed our booking form, a contract exists between you and us. The Lead Name guarantees that he or she has full authority to make the Holiday booking on behalf of all customers named on the Holiday booking and guarantees to pay all sums which are or may become due in relation to such Holiday. </p><br><p>The purchase and sale of the Holiday shall take place (or shall be deemed to take place) and come into effect in the UAE, whatever the circumstances of your booking. Notwithstanding any conflict of laws principles, these booking conditions and any contract between you and us shall be governed exclusively by the laws of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and the federal laws of the UAE, and the Civil Courts of the UAE in Abu Dhabi shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine any dispute or claim that arises out of or in connection with the contract with you or its subject matter or formation (including non- contractual disputes or claims). </p><div class="header"><br><p>2. How to Book</p></div><br><p> A Holiday booking can be made through Etihad Holidays Retail Shops, Sales Offices or directly with the Etihad Holidays Call Centre +9712 5990700 in the UAE or through a Travel Agent. </p><br><p>When a booking is made via a Travel Agent, all communication with Etihad Holidays must be made via the Travel Agent. In that case, all monies paid by you to the Travel Agent are held by the Travel Agent as your agent until the booking is accepted and confirmed by Etihad Holidays. </p><div class="header"><br><p>3. Payment</p></div><br><p> A booking form must be completed and signed by the Lead Name being a person aged 18 years or over and a non-refundable deposit paid to Etihad Holidays of 10% of the total package cost. Should your Holiday incorporate a specialist holiday component such as Cruise Companies, ("Specialist Holiday") and some hotels a full payment will be required and will be advised at the time of booking. If the booking is made 16 days or less prior to departure full payment will also be required for your Holiday booking. </p><br><p>If a deposit has been paid the full balance must be settled no later than 16 days before your departure date. If we do not receive the balance by the due date we will treat the booking as cancelled by you and you agree to pay the cancellation charges as described in section 5.2 of these booking conditions. We accept cash, cheques, credit and debit cards. </p><br><p>Once full payment has been received for a confirmed booking, Etihad Holidays will issue air E-tickets plus vouchers for other services booked. These vouchers must be surrendered by you to the relevant supplier of the services, e.g. hotel or ground transportation supplier. </p><div class="header"><br><p>4. Holiday Price</p></div><br><p> All our prices are quoted in AED, (unless otherwise specified). We will give you or your Travel Agent a price quote at the time of booking and once you have accepted that price and a booking has been made and confirmed through payment of deposit or in full, we will hold that price. </p><br><p>The only additional charges we may pass on to you are those imposed by the UAE or foreign governments, other regulatory bodies and/or airlines. </p><br><p><strong>What your Holiday price usually includes (subject to our confirmation in writing):</strong> <br>- return transportation including luggage allowance as confirmed; <br>- overseas transfers / transportation as confirmed; <br>- accommodation, meals (including any bonus offers) where they have been booked and confirmed; <br>- the services of a representative, tour guide or an appointed local agent, including a 24-hour emergency contact (except cruises); <br>- any other services e.g. excursions, car rental, ski packs, etc. where they have been booked and confirmed; and <br>- Child discounts where they have been booked and confirmed. </p><br><p><strong>What your Holiday price does not include:</strong> <br>- passport, visa and health protection fees; <br>- cots, car seats and food for infants; <br>- meals unless otherwise specified; <br>- excursions or entrance fees unless otherwise specified; <br>- overseas airport departure charges payable locally; <br>- porterage, personal expenditure, tips, laundry, hotel extras; <br>- transport cost to your departure airport unless specified; <br>- Holiday insurance </p><div class="header"><br><p>5. Changes or cancellation by you</p></div><br><p> <strong>5.1. Changes</strong> <br>If you wish to change your booking after a deposit has been paid, the Lead Name should contact their Travel Agent if they booked via a Travel Agent; or Etihad Holidays if they booked directly and subject to availability, we will try to meet the request. </p><br><p>If we are able to make the change requested, you agree to pay a non-refundable amendment fee of AED 200/- per person per change if the change(s) is / are made 16 days or more before departure in addition to any applicable ticket change fees or increase in Holiday costs i.e. where you upgrade accommodation or increase passengers. Changes made 15 days or less before departure will be treated as a cancellation and the charges in section 5.2 will apply. </p><br><p>We may, at our sole discretion, waive charges due to be made if the changes increase the cost of your Holiday and do not involve a change of destination / departure date. </p><strong>Important notes:</strong> <br>Many suppliers, particularly airlines, cruise companies, Disneyland® Resorts, Ski & Safari operators and some hotels do not permit us to change names or travel dates and impose full cancellation charges. </p><br><p>If this is the case, we will pass these charges on to you, in addition to our administration charges. Some accommodation types, particularly self-catering, cruise ship cabins and hotel rooms with reductions for 3+ people, are priced according to the number of occupants. If fewer people travel than originally booked there will be extra charges to pay, which will be advised to you when you make the changes. </p><strong>5.2. Cancellations</strong> <br>If you or any member of your party wishes to cancel your booking once a booking has been confirmed and an invoice or receipt has been issued, the Lead Name must notify their Travel Agent (or Etihad Holidays direct if the booking was made directly with Etihad Holidays) in writing. The cancellation charges you will be required to pay will be calculated on the basis of the date we receive the written notification and the booked departure date. Please note we cannot refund deposits, amendment fees or insurance premiums. We strongly recommend that you take out comprehensive holiday insurance which includes cancellation cover. We incur costs from the time you make your booking and you agree that if you cancel your booking, you will compensate us for our expenses and losses as per the table and paragraphs below or if greater (for example if cruise companies, Disneyland® Resorts, Ski & Safari operators and some hotels are concerned) the cost borne by us as a result of your cancellation. </p><br><p>Cancellation charges vary according to the type of Holiday booked and certain hotels and products. You will be advised at the time of booking of the relevant cancellation terms and conditions. </p><strong>a) Etihad Holidays Packages</strong> <br><p><table class="MsoNormalTable" style="width: 435.0pt; mso-cellspacing: 0in; mso-yfti-tbllook: 1184; mso-padding-alt: 0in 0in 0in 0in;" width="580" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody> <tr style="mso-yfti-irow: 0; mso-yfti-firstrow: yes; height: 15.0pt;"> <td style="width: 275.25pt; background: #333333; padding: 0in 0in 0in 0in; height: 15.0pt;" width="367"> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: \'Arial\',\'sans-serif\'; mso-fareast-font-family: \'Times New Roman\'; color: white;">&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp; Number of days between the booked departure date and the&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp; written Cancellation is received by us<br /> &nbsp;</span></strong></p> </td> <td style="width: 159.75pt; background: #333333; padding: 0in 0in 0in 0in; height: 15.0pt;" width="213"> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: \'Arial\',\'sans-serif\'; mso-fareast-font-family: \'Times New Roman\'; color: white;">Cancellation amount as a % of price</span></strong></p> </td> </tr> <tr style="mso-yfti-irow: 1; height: 15.0pt;"> <td style="width: 275.25pt; border: none; border-bottom: solid windowtext 1.0pt; mso-border-bottom-alt: solid windowtext .75pt; padding: 0in 0in 0in 0in; height: 15.0pt;" width="367"> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: \'Arial\',\'sans-serif\'; mso-fareast-font-family: \'Times New Roman\';">&nbsp; 15 - 8 days</span></p> </td> <td style="width: 159.75pt; border: none; border-bottom: solid windowtext 1.0pt; mso-border-bottom-alt: solid windowtext .75pt; padding: 0in 0in 0in 0in; height: 15.0pt;" width="213"> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: \'Arial\',\'sans-serif\'; mso-fareast-font-family: \'Times New Roman\';">15%</span></p> </td> </tr> <tr style="mso-yfti-irow: 2; height: 15.0pt;"> <td style="width: 275.25pt; border-top: solid windowtext 1.0pt; border-left: none; border-bottom: solid windowtext 1.0pt; border-right: none; mso-border-top-alt: solid windowtext .75pt; mso-border-bottom-alt: solid windowtext .75pt; padding: 0in 0in 0in 0in; height: 15.0pt;" width="367"> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: \'Arial\',\'sans-serif\'; mso-fareast-font-family: \'Times New Roman\';">&nbsp; 7 - 4 days</span></p> </td> <td style="width: 159.75pt; border-top: solid windowtext 1.0pt; border-left: none; border-bottom: solid windowtext 1.0pt; border-right: none; mso-border-top-alt: solid windowtext .75pt; mso-border-bottom-alt: solid windowtext .75pt; padding: 0in 0in 0in 0in; height: 15.0pt;" width="213"> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: \'Arial\',\'sans-serif\'; mso-fareast-font-family: \'Times New Roman\';">30%</span></p> </td> </tr> <tr style="mso-yfti-irow: 3; mso-yfti-lastrow: yes; height: 15.0pt;"> <td style="width: 275.25pt; border-top: solid windowtext 1.0pt; border-left: none; border-bottom: solid windowtext 1.0pt; border-right: none; mso-border-top-alt: solid windowtext .75pt; mso-border-bottom-alt: solid windowtext .75pt; padding: 0in 0in 0in 0in; height: 15.0pt;" width="367"> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: \'Arial\',\'sans-serif\'; mso-fareast-font-family: \'Times New Roman\';">&nbsp; 3 days or less &amp; no show</span></p> </td> <td style="width: 159.75pt; border-top: solid windowtext 1.0pt; border-left: none; border-bottom: solid windowtext 1.0pt; border-right: none; mso-border-top-alt: solid windowtext .75pt; mso-border-bottom-alt: solid windowtext .75pt; padding: 0in 0in 0in 0in; height: 15.0pt;" width="213"> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: \'Arial\',\'sans-serif\'; mso-fareast-font-family: \'Times New Roman\';">100%</span></p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </p><br><p>b) Exceptions - All Etihad Holidays Packages to Maldives, Seychelles and Mauritius as well as Specialist Holidays to any destination involving Cruises, Safaris, Ski, Extended Touring & Self Drive itineraries and Disneyland® Resorts.
